# 42 Piscine Rush Solutions
#### (and custom rush01 tester)

These are my solutions to the piscine rushes. Including all sub-problems of rush00 and the now removed rush02.
For rush01 I also implemented a tester program and script that uses a cases file to rigurously test the functionality of the solver.
The cases file has not been created by me, but rather given for evaluation purposes. I built the tester parser around the format of this cases file.
All evals and subjects have been specifically ignored by the repository to prevent cheating.
**DO NOT USE MY SOLUTIONS DIRECTLY, I WILL KNOW.**
